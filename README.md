The Information Technology of the University of Oklahoma (OU IT) form the backbone of the school by creating and maintaining the best possible learning environments through world-class IT services. Learning Spaces and Services, a part of OU IT, have been pioneering in the mission by supporting academics with updated, standardized, and user-friendly technology in around 150 centrally scheduled classrooms. Both departments having close to 100 student employees (PTEs) mentored by highly talented and innovative full-time employees make this possible. But there was no employee’s portal to track PTE’s timesheets, attendance infractions, time-off requests, or a way for the full-time employees to appraise their performance over the semester and subsequent pay raise at the beginning of the immediate semester. Moreover, it was the frustration of students not having something to keep track of their timesheet and their attendance infractions at a single place led the necessity to have a portal.
